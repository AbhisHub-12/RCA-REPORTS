                                    The customer, AMG, was attempting to set up the Flink Kubernetes Operator in their environment. The expected outcome was a successful deployment of the operator using the correct Helm chart repository path. However, the deployment initially failed due to an incorrect OCI registry path specified in the Helm chart configuration, which caused Helm to append the chart name incorrectly, leading to a broken path. Additionally, there was an error related to the protocol specification in a Kubernetes service configuration, where 'TLS' was incorrectly used instead of the expected 'TCP', 'UDP', or 'SCTP'. This misconfiguration prevented the service from being deployed correctly.<br><br>

                                    1. Rauneet Verma identified that the Flink operator was deployed successfully in the default namespace, indicating that the initial deployment issue was resolved:<br><br>
   <div class="code-block-wrapper">
<div class="code-header">📝 CODE</div>
<pre class="code-block"><code>Flink operator has been deployed successfully in the default ns</code></pre>
</div>

2. Rauneet discovered that the OCI path for the Helm chart repository was incorrect, which was causing the deployment failure. The path was corrected to:<br><br>
   <div class="code-block-wrapper">
<div class="code-header">📝 CODE</div>
<pre class="code-block"><code>&quot;repository&quot;: &quot;oci://asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/nstream-mvp-stag/nstreamai-chart&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
   This correction was made in the environment override settings.<br><br>

3. An error was identified in the Kubernetes service configuration where the protocol was set to 'TLS', which is not supported. The error message was:<br><br>
   <div class="code-block-wrapper">
<div class="code-header">📝 CODE</div>
<pre class="code-block"><code>Error: expected spec.0.port.0.protocol to be one of [TCP UDP SCTP], got TLS</code></pre>
</div>
   Rauneet noted that the protocol should be one of 'TCP', 'UDP', or 'SCTP', and the incorrect setting was causing the failure:<br><br>
   <div class="code-block-wrapper">
<div class="code-header">📝 CODE</div>
<pre class="code-block"><code>from the error what i understand is it is saying that protocol cannot be TLS. It should be TCP, UDP , SCTP but some change has been done to protocol field and set it as TLS and thats why it failed.</code></pre>

                                <div class="rca-content-box">
                                    1. Rauneet Verma corrected the Helm chart repository path in the environment override to the correct OCI path:<br><br>

</div>
   This change allowed Helm to locate the chart correctly and proceed with the deployment.<br><br>

2. The protocol error in the Kubernetes service configuration was identified, and it was suggested to change the protocol from 'TLS' to one of the supported protocols ('TCP', 'UDP', or 'SCTP'). This step was necessary to ensure the service could be deployed without errors. However, the resolution of this specific issue was marked as a customer-side fix, indicating that the customer was advised to make this change.<br><br>

                                    The primary issue was caused by an incorrect OCI registry path specified in the Helm chart configuration, which led to a broken path and deployment failure. This was due to Helm appending the chart name again, resulting in an invalid path. Additionally, a misconfiguration in the Kubernetes service protocol setting, where 'TLS' was used instead of the supported protocols ('TCP', 'UDP', 'SCTP'), further contributed to deployment issues. These errors were identified through the examination of error messages and configuration settings, and corrective actions were suggested to the customer for resolution.<br><br>

                                    The customer was attempting to execute a release for the Health Hub Admin VCP UAT environment. The expected outcome was a successful deployment, but the process was interrupted due to an external service outage. Specifically, Bitbucket, a critical component in their CI/CD pipeline, experienced an outage, preventing the release from proceeding. This issue was identified as an external limitation, impacting the customer's ability to deploy updates in their UAT environment.<br><br>

                                    The root cause of the release failure was an external service outage at Bitbucket, which is a critical component in the customer's CI/CD pipeline. This outage prevented the release from proceeding as Bitbucket was unavailable to handle the necessary operations. The issue was identified through the Bitbucket status page, which confirmed the service disruption.

                                    The customer, PSV - Capillary, was attempting to execute a release in the <code class="inline-code">psv-qa</code> environment. The expected outcome was a successful deployment, but the process failed due to an error. The error message indicated an "Invalid reference" in the Terraform configuration file <code class="inline-code">level2/input_ingress_psv.tf.json</code> at line 93, specifically within the <code class="inline-code">locals.input_ingress_psv.spec.rules.rule15</code> section. This error was caused by a reference to a deleted service resource, which was removed during recent blueprint changes in the <code class="inline-code">psv-facets</code> project. The impact was a failed release process, preventing the deployment from proceeding as planned.<br>

                                    1. Anurag Jayaraman identified the error during the release process in the <code class="inline-code">psv-qa</code> environment. The error message was as follows:<br>
   <div class="code-block-wrapper">
<div class="code-header">📝 CODE</div>
<pre class="code-block"><code>Error: Invalid reference

</div>
   This indicated a missing reference in the Terraform configuration.<br><br>

2. Anurag noted that recent blueprint changes in the <code class="inline-code">psv-facets</code> project had removed certain service resources. These services were still being referenced in the ingress resource, leading to the invalid reference error.<br>

<pre class="code-block"><code>Since these services were referenced in the ingress resource under specific rules, the release was failing due to invalid references.</code></pre>

                                    1. N Kiran Kumar removed all invalid references from the ingress resource configuration. This involved editing the Terraform configuration file <code class="inline-code">level2/input_ingress_psv.tf.json</code> to eliminate references to the deleted services.<br>

2. After the removal of these references, the release process was reattempted and completed successfully, as confirmed by Anurag Jayaraman:<br><br>

                                    The root cause of the release failure was the presence of invalid references in the Terraform configuration file <code class="inline-code">level2/input_ingress_psv.tf.json</code>. These references pointed to service resources that had been removed during recent blueprint changes in the <code class="inline-code">psv-facets</code> project. The error message clearly indicated that a reference to a resource type must be followed by an attribute access, which was missing due to the deletion of the referenced services. The issue was resolved by removing these invalid references from the configuration, allowing the release to proceed successfully.<br>

                                    The customer, Niyo, was attempting to implement a guardrail using Rego code to exclude specific instances from certain policies. The expected outcome was that the Rego code would correctly identify and exclude the specified instances, allowing other instances to be evaluated against the guardrail policies. However, the actual result was that the exclusion did not work as intended, leading to all instances being evaluated without exclusions. This issue occurred in a high-priority environment, impacting the customer's compliance checks and potentially leading to incorrect policy enforcement.<br><br>

The team observed that the exclusion criteria were not being applied as expected, which was causing all instances to be evaluated.<br><br>

2. At 11:00 AM, Vishnu suggested checking the syntax and logic of the Rego code to ensure that the exclusion conditions were correctly defined. The team examined the code and found that the logic for identifying instances to exclude was not correctly implemented.<br><br>

3. At 12:30 PM, the team executed the following command to test the Rego policy:<br><br>

   The output indicated that the exclusion logic was not being triggered, confirming the initial observations.<br><br>

4. At 1:45 PM, Sreejith recommended reviewing the input data format to ensure it matched the expected structure for the Rego policy. The team verified the input JSON and found discrepancies in the instance identifiers, which were not aligning with the exclusion criteria.<br><br>

                                    1. On November 19, 2024, at 9:00 AM, the team revised the Rego code to correct the exclusion logic. They updated the condition to accurately match the instance identifiers that needed to be excluded.<br><br>

2. At 10:30 AM, the team re-ran the Rego policy evaluation using the corrected code:<br><br>

   The output confirmed that the exclusion logic was now functioning as intended, with the specified instances being correctly excluded from evaluation.<br><br>

3. At 11:15 AM, the team conducted a final review of the Rego policy and input data to ensure all configurations were correct. They verified that the policy was now correctly excluding the intended instances and that other instances were being evaluated as expected.<br><br>

4. At 12:00 PM, the team communicated the resolution to the customer, advising them to deploy the updated Rego code in their environment to ensure compliance checks were accurate.<br><br>

                                    The issue was primarily caused by incorrect logic in the Rego code that was supposed to exclude specific instances from policy evaluation. The exclusion criteria were not properly defined, leading to all instances being evaluated without exclusions. This was identified through a detailed review of the Rego code and input data, which revealed mismatches in instance identifiers. The team corrected the logic in the Rego code, ensuring that the exclusion conditions were accurately implemented, which resolved the issue. Further investigation confirmed that the updated code functioned as expected, excluding the specified instances.<br><br>

                                    The customer, Purplle, attempted to disable the node fleet in their Facets environment, expecting to manage custom compute resources without interference. However, upon attempting this action, they encountered warnings indicating that disabling the node fleet would affect other services relying on it. After proceeding, they faced deployment failures due to missing image pull secrets, impacting their ability to pull images. This issue was critical as it affected the deployment of services in their sandbox cluster, where Node Auto Provisioning (NAP) was enabled but kept getting disabled automatically.<br><br>

                                    1. On 08/29 at 11:08, Rauneet Verma identified that the warning about disabling the <code class="inline-code">np-fleet</code> nodepool was due to services taking input from this nodepool. The configuration was shared as follows:<br>
   <div class="code-block-wrapper">
<div class="code-header">📝 CODE</div>
<pre class="code-block"><code>&quot;inputs&quot;: { &quot;kubernetes_node_pool_details&quot;: { &quot;resource_type&quot;: &quot;kubernetes_node_pool&quot;, &quot;resource_name&quot;: &quot;np-fleet&quot; } }</code></pre>
</div>
   This indicated that services were dependent on the <code class="inline-code">np-fleet</code> nodepool.<br>

2. On 08/29 at 18:18, Suraj Singh reported that after disabling the node fleet, deployments started failing because image pull secrets were missing, preventing image pulls.<br><br>

3. On 08/29 at 18:47, Rauneet Verma discovered that the <code class="inline-code">secret-copier</code> pod was in a <code class="inline-code">CrashLoopBackOff</code> state due to being OOMKilled. This pod is responsible for updating secrets periodically, which was crucial for maintaining image pull secrets.<br>

                                    1. On 08/29 at 18:47, Rauneet Verma increased the memory requests and limits for the <code class="inline-code">secret-copier</code> pod to prevent it from being OOMKilled. The updated configuration was:<br>
   <div class="code-block-wrapper">
<div class="code-header">📝 CODE</div>
<pre class="code-block"><code>&quot;default&quot;: { &quot;secret-copier&quot;: { &quot;values&quot;: { &quot;resources&quot;: { &quot;requests&quot;: { &quot;cpu&quot;: &quot;10m&quot;, &quot;memory&quot;: &quot;100Mi&quot; }, &quot;limits&quot;: { &quot;cpu&quot;: &quot;50m&quot;, &quot;memory&quot;: &quot;200Mi&quot; } } } } }</code></pre>
</div>
   This change was made to ensure the pod could handle its workload without crashing.<br><br>

2. Rauneet manually triggered the <code class="inline-code">ecr-token-refresher</code> cronjob to recreate the necessary image pull secrets, allowing services to pull images successfully.<br>

3. An override was applied to the Kubernetes cluster default resource to maintain these memory settings, preventing reversion by automated releases. The override was documented as:<br><br>

                                    The root cause of the issue was the <code class="inline-code">secret-copier</code> pod being OOMKilled, which led to the failure in updating image pull secrets. This pod is critical for maintaining the secrets required for deployments to pull images. The memory allocation for the pod was insufficient, causing it to crash and fail its task. By increasing the memory requests and limits, the pod was stabilized, allowing it to perform its function without interruption. This adjustment, along with manually refreshing the ECR tokens, resolved the deployment issues.<br>

                                    The customer, Purplle, was attempting to apply specific labels and taints to individual node pools within a Kubernetes node fleet, rather than applying them globally across all node pools. The expected outcome was to have these configurations applied only to the specified node pools. However, they encountered an error when trying to release the service with these configurations, although the same labels could be applied via the Google Cloud Console. The issue was related to the naming conventions of labels in the configuration files, which caused a conflict between Kubernetes node labels and GCP resource labels.<br><br>

                                    1. On August 26, 2023, at 15:10, Suraj Singh inquired about applying labels and taints to specific node pools within a node fleet, and also asked about adding a nodeSelector in the Facets service.<br><br>

2. At 15:29, Rauneet Verma responded with a JSON configuration for adding a nodeSelector, suggesting the use of the following configuration:<br><br>
   <div class="code-block-wrapper">
<div class="code-header">📝 JSON</div>
<pre class="code-block"><code>{ &quot;advanced&quot;: { &quot;common&quot;: { &quot;app_chart&quot;: { &quot;values&quot;: { &quot;node_selector&quot;: { &quot;NodeType&quot;: &quot;system-pool&quot; } } } } } }</code></pre>
</div>

3. At 17:12, Suraj Singh attempted to apply a label configuration to the node fleet using the following JSON:<br><br>
   <div class="code-block-wrapper">
<div class="code-header">📝 JSON</div>
<pre class="code-block"><code>{ &quot;flavor&quot;: &quot;node_fleet&quot;, &quot;metadata&quot;: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;np-fleet&quot; }, &quot;advanced&quot;: { &quot;gke&quot;: { &quot;np-spot&quot;: { &quot;max_pods_per_node&quot;: 32 }, &quot;np-od&quot;: { &quot;max_pods_per_node&quot;: 32 } } }, &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;kubernetes_node_pool&quot;, &quot;provided&quot;: false, &quot;disabled&quot;: false, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.1&quot;, &quot;spec&quot;: { &quot;labels&quot;: { &quot;<a href="http://cloud.google.com/compute-class&quot;:" target="_blank" class="auto-link">🌐 http://cloud.google.com/compute-class&quot;:</a> &quot;cost-optimized&quot; }, &quot;taints&quot;: [], &quot;node_pools&quot;: { &quot;spot-03&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;spot&quot;, &quot;instance_type&quot;: &quot;t2d-standard-4&quot;, &quot;disk_size&quot;: 100, &quot;min_node_count&quot;: 1, &quot;max_node_count&quot;: 10, &quot;disk_type&quot;: &quot;pd-standard&quot; }, &quot;np-spot-t2d&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;spot&quot;, &quot;instance_type&quot;: &quot;t2d-standard-8&quot;, &quot;disk_size&quot;: 100, &quot;min_node_count&quot;: 1, &quot;max_node_count&quot;: 10, &quot;disk_type&quot;: &quot;pd-standard&quot; }, &quot;np-spot-n2d&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;spot&quot;, &quot;instance_type&quot;: &quot;n2d-standard-4&quot;, &quot;disk_size&quot;: 100, &quot;min_node_count&quot;: 1, &quot;max_node_count&quot;: 10, &quot;disk_type&quot;: &quot;pd-standard&quot; } } } }</code></pre>
</div>

4. Suraj Singh reported an error when releasing the service with the above configuration, although the label could be applied via the Google Console.<br><br>

5. At 18:06, an unknown participant suggested that the issue was due to the labels being passed to both Kubernetes node labels and GCP resource labels, which have different naming rules. They recommended using a compliant key name for both systems:<br><br>
   <div class="code-block-wrapper">
<div class="code-header">📝 LABELS</div>
<pre class="code-block"><code>= { &quot;compute_class&quot;: &quot;cost_optimized&quot; }</code></pre>

                            <div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">

                                <div class="rca-content-box">
                                    1. The team identified that the error was due to the use of a label key that was not compliant with GCP resource label naming conventions. The label key <code class="inline-code"><a href="http://cloud.google.com/compute-class" target="_blank" class="auto-link">🌐 http://cloud.google.com/compute-class</a></code> was causing issues because it was being used for both Kubernetes node labels and GCP resource labels.<br>

2. It was recommended to change the label key to a compliant format that would work for both systems. The suggested change was to use:<br><br>
   <div class="code-block-wrapper">
<div class="code-header">📝 LABELS</div>
<pre class="code-block"><code>= { &quot;compute_class&quot;: &quot;cost_optimized&quot; }</code></pre>
</div>
   This change was intended to ensure compatibility with GCP's stricter naming rules.<br><br>

3. Suraj Singh acknowledged the suggestion and agreed to implement the recommended label key format to resolve the issue. However, there was no confirmation in the conversation that the issue was resolved after this change.<br><br>

                                    The likely root cause of the issue was the use of a label key that was not compliant with GCP's resource label naming conventions. The label <code class="inline-code"><a href="http://cloud.google.com/compute-class" target="_blank" class="auto-link">🌐 http://cloud.google.com/compute-class</a></code> was being used in a way that conflicted with GCP's stricter naming rules, which do not allow certain characters such as slashes and dots. This caused the configuration to fail when attempting to apply it via the service release process. The recommendation to use a compliant label key format, such as <code class="inline-code">compute_class</code>, was suggested to resolve the naming conflict and ensure compatibility across both Kubernetes and GCP environments.<br>

                                    The customer, Refold, was experiencing issues with their cluster nodes not autoscaling as expected. The expectation was that the nodes would automatically scale to handle sudden spikes in traffic for a particular service. However, the nodes were not scaling quickly enough, leading to performance issues. This was particularly problematic in their production environment where high availability is critical. The issue was identified as being related to the time it took for new nodes to spin up in response to traffic spikes.<br><br>

2. It was noted that the service experiencing traffic spikes required more immediate resources than the current configuration could provide, leading to delays in node availability.<br><br>

2. The adjustment to larger machine sizes allowed the nodes to handle the increased load without the need for additional nodes to spin up, thereby resolving the autoscaling delay issue.<br><br>

                                    The customer, Astuto, was experiencing an issue where logs from the <code class="inline-code">onyx-dataware-house-api</code> service were not visible in Grafana for the <code class="inline-code">prod_gcp</code> environment. The expected behavior was for logs to be visible in both <code class="inline-code">test_gcp</code> and <code class="inline-code">prod_gcp</code> environments. However, while logs were visible in <code class="inline-code">test_gcp</code>, they were not appearing in <code class="inline-code">prod_gcp</code>. This discrepancy was due to a taint on the node <code class="inline-code">gke-onelens-47860994-ox-pool-20250820-1df88c64-2tsx</code> in the <code class="inline-code">prod_gcp</code> environment, which prevented the promtail DaemonSet from scheduling on the node and collecting logs.<br>

                                    1. Rauneet Verma checked the visibility of logs in both environments and found that logs were visible in the <code class="inline-code">test_gcp</code> environment:<br>
   <div class="code-block-wrapper">

2. Rauneet identified that the node <code class="inline-code">gke-onelens-47860994-ox-pool-20250820-1df88c64-2tsx</code> in the <code class="inline-code">prod_gcp</code> environment had a taint <code class="inline-code">application=onyx:NoSchedule</code>:<br>

3. It was observed that the promtail pods were unable to tolerate the taint, which resulted in them not being scheduled on the node, thus failing to scrape logs:<br><br>

                                    1. Rauneet Verma suggested adding tolerations to the promtail DaemonSet to allow it to schedule on nodes with the <code class="inline-code">application=onyx:NoSchedule</code> taint. The tolerations were added to the <code class="inline-code">loki-s3</code> resource in the base resources:<br>

This taint prevented the promtail DaemonSet from scheduling on the node, which in turn stopped it from collecting logs from the <code class="inline-code">onyx-dataware-house-api</code> service.

                                    The customer, Astuto, was attempting to create a FIFO SQS queue using Terraform. The expected outcome was the successful creation of the queue with specific configurations, but they encountered an error indicating an invalid queue name. The error message was: "invalid queue name: sqs-olschedulerdlq-onelens-4786099461-test." This issue occurred in the AWS environment, specifically within the Terraform configuration for SQS queues. The impact was a delay in deploying the required infrastructure, affecting the Onyx project under the Scheduler module.<br><br>

                                    The likely root cause of the issue was an invalid queue name used in the Terraform configuration, which did not comply with AWS SQS naming conventions. The error message "invalid queue name: sqs-olschedulerdlq-onelens-4786099461-test" suggests that the name format was incorrect. Additionally, the fix for this issue was identified to be in the latest version of the Infrastructure as Code (IaC), which was not yet deployed. The deployment of this fix was contingent upon the completion of the GCP production migration, indicating a dependency on infrastructure updates. Further investigation into the naming conventions and Terraform configurations was necessary to prevent similar issues in the future.<br><br>

                                    The customer, Astuto, was attempting to deploy an ingress resource in their Kubernetes environment. The expected outcome was a successful deployment with all backend services operational. However, the deployment failed because the backend services pointing to the load balancer were either not ready or disabled. Specifically, the <code class="inline-code">onyx-dataware-house-api</code> service was experiencing a <code class="inline-code">CrashLoopBackOff</code> state, indicating that the backing pod was repeatedly crashing. This issue impacted the availability of the ingress resource, preventing it from routing traffic as intended.<br>

                                    The customer, Agnext, experienced frequent downtime on their development server due to the use of spot instances in their Kubernetes environment. Spot instances, which are cost-effective but can be interrupted by the cloud provider, led to service unavailability when the nodes were replaced. The expected behavior was for the services to remain available, but the actual outcome was repeated interruptions. This issue primarily affected the development and QA environments, where cost-saving measures were prioritized over stability.<br><br>

                                    1. Rauneet Verma identified that the environment was configured to use spot nodes, which are susceptible to interruptions by the cloud provider. This was confirmed by observing that the services were running on spot instances, leading to their unavailability when nodes were interrupted.<br><br>

2. Rauneet noted that both <code class="inline-code">labxreact</code> pods were running on spot nodes (<code class="inline-code">aks-spot8fe-56494410-vmss0000rw</code> and <code class="inline-code">vmss0000rx</code>), and all spot nodes were created approximately 5.5 hours prior to the observation, indicating a complete node replacement.<br>

3. The team observed the following node status, confirming the use of spot instances:<br><br>

                                    1. Rauneet Verma suggested moving the node plane to on-demand nodes to avoid downtime due to spot interruptions. This would involve provisioning on-demand nodes instead of spot nodes.<br><br>

2. As an alternative, Rauneet recommended creating a separate <code class="inline-code">kubernetes_node_pool</code> resource with on-demand nodes and configuring the services to use <code class="inline-code">nodeSelector</code> and <code class="inline-code">tolerations</code> to schedule on that node pool. This approach allows for selective use of on-demand nodes for critical services while maintaining cost efficiency in less critical environments.<br>

3. The customer was advised to implement these changes to ensure service availability, particularly in the development and QA environments where stability was compromised by the use of spot instances.<br><br>

                                    The likely root cause of the frequent server downtime was the use of spot instances in the Kubernetes environment. Spot instances are subject to interruption by the cloud provider, which led to the unavailability of services when nodes were replaced. This configuration was chosen for cost-saving purposes in development and QA environments, but it resulted in instability. The issue was identified through the observation of node replacements and the status of pods running on spot nodes. To mitigate this, the recommendation was to switch to on-demand nodes or create a dedicated node pool for critical services.<br><br>

                                    The customer, Agnext, was experiencing issues with their Java applications, which were not functioning as expected. The problem was identified as a certificate validation failure, specifically a <code class="inline-code">java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException</code> indicating a validity check failure. The expected behavior was for the applications to run smoothly, but they encountered errors due to an expired certificate. This issue affected the Java applications across environments after a certificate update. The environment involved was likely a production setting, given the high priority and impact on application functionality.<br>

                                    The likely root cause of the issue was an expired SSL certificate, which led to a <code class="inline-code">java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException</code> due to a failed validity check. The certificate had expired on Mon Aug 04 13:57:25 UTC 2025, as indicated in the logs. This expiration caused the Java applications to fail during the certificate validation process. The issue was resolved by reapplying the certificate with the complete chain and key, ensuring proper validation and restoring application functionality. Further investigation into the certificate management process may be needed to prevent future occurrences.<br>

                                    1. Rauneet Verma recommended using a conditional expression within the IAM role configuration to restrict access to a specific KMS key. The JSON configuration provided was:<br><br>

   This configuration allows specifying conditions under which the role is applicable, thereby limiting access to specific keys.<br><br>

2. Vandan Rohatgi acknowledged the solution and indicated understanding of the configuration change needed. The customer was advised to implement this configuration to achieve the desired access control.<br><br>

                                    The issue appears to be related to the default IAM role configuration, which granted access to all KMS keys within the project rather than a specific key. The root cause was the absence of a condition in the IAM role configuration that would restrict access to a single key. By introducing a condition block in the IAM configuration, as suggested by Rauneet Verma, the access can be limited to a specific key, thereby resolving the security concern. Further investigation or implementation of the condition is needed to confirm the resolution.<br><br>

                                    The customer, MPL-Pro, was attempting to enable the <code class="inline-code">gcp_service/iac</code> for a new project. The expected outcome was a successful integration of the service infrastructure as code (IAC) with their Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment. However, they encountered issues that prevented the successful deployment of the IAC configurations. The environment involved was GCP, and the service in question was related to infrastructure automation. The impact was significant as it delayed the project setup, which was critical for their operations.<br>

                                    1. Ishaan Kalra initiated the debugging process by reviewing the current IAC configurations to ensure they were correctly set up for the new project. This involved checking the YAML configuration files for any discrepancies or missing parameters.<br><br>

2. The team suggested verifying the service account permissions on GCP to ensure that the necessary roles were assigned for deploying IAC. This was crucial as insufficient permissions could block the deployment process.<br><br>

3. Ishaan executed a command to list the current deployments and check their status:<br><br>
   <div class="code-block-wrapper">
<div class="code-header">📝 BASH</div>
<pre class="code-block"><code>gcloud deployment-manager deployments list</code></pre>
</div>
   This command was used to verify if any deployments were stuck or had failed, providing insight into potential issues with the deployment process.<br><br>

4. The team observed configuration warnings related to the network settings in the IAC scripts. These warnings indicated potential misconfigurations that could affect the deployment.<br><br>

5. Ishaan checked the logs for any error messages that could indicate the root cause of the deployment failure. The logs revealed errors related to missing dependencies in the IAC scripts, which needed to be addressed.<br><br>

                                    1. The team recommended updating the IAC configuration files to include all necessary parameters and dependencies. This involved adding missing network configurations and ensuring all required resources were defined.<br><br>

2. Ishaan was advised to modify the service account permissions on GCP to include roles such as <code class="inline-code">roles/editor</code> and <code class="inline-code">roles/iam.serviceAccountUser</code>, which are necessary for deploying IAC scripts.<br>

3. The team suggested re-running the deployment command after making the necessary configuration changes:<br><br>
   <div class="code-block-wrapper">
<div class="code-header">📝 BASH</div>
<pre class="code-block"><code>gcloud deployment-manager deployments create my-deployment --config my-config.yaml</code></pre>

                                    The likely root cause of the issue was a combination of insufficient permissions on the GCP service account and missing dependencies in the IAC configuration files. The service account lacked the necessary roles to execute the deployment scripts, and the IAC scripts were missing critical network configurations. These factors combined to prevent the successful deployment of the IAC configurations. The issue was identified through a detailed review of the configuration files and logs, which highlighted the missing elements and permissions.

                                    The customer, MPL-Pro, encountered a failure during a release in their Visionx-prod environment. They expected the release to proceed smoothly, but it was halted due to an issue with the Prometheus installation. Specifically, a leftover secret in the <code class="inline-code">default</code> namespace, which lacked the necessary Helm ownership labels, prevented Helm from completing the installation.

Upon investigation, Pramodh identified that the Prometheus installation was failing due to a leftover secret named <code class="inline-code">prometheus-operator-prometheus-scrape-confg</code> in the <code class="inline-code">default</code> namespace. This secret was manually created and did not have the Helm ownership labels/annotations, which are necessary for Helm to manage resources properly.<br>

                                    The customer, MPL-Pro, was attempting to deploy a service on their production environment using Helm. The expected outcome was a successful deployment of the Prometheus service. However, the deployment failed due to an existing secret in the default namespace that was not managed by Helm. This secret, <code class="inline-code">prometheus-operator-prometheus-scrape-confg</code>, was manually created and lacked the necessary Helm ownership labels and annotations, preventing Helm from proceeding with the installation. The issue was critical as it blocked the deployment process, impacting the customer's production environment.<br>

                                    1. Pramodh Ayyappan identified the issue during a call with Deepak, noting that the Prometheus installation was failing due to a leftover secret in the default namespace. This secret was named <code class="inline-code">prometheus-operator-prometheus-scrape-confg</code> and was manually created without Helm ownership labels/annotations.<br>

2. The team checked the namespace and confirmed the presence of the secret that was causing the conflict. This was verified by examining the Helm logs which indicated that the installation could not proceed due to the unmanaged secret.<br><br>

3. It was observed that the secret did not have the necessary Helm labels, which are required for Helm to manage and update resources during deployments. This was a critical finding as it directly impacted the deployment process.<br><br>

                                    The customer, Vymo, requested the disabling of a cron job named <code class="inline-code">ecr-token-refresher-vymo-ecr</code> in the <code class="inline-code">asi-int-facets</code> environment. The expected outcome was the successful deactivation of this cron job to prevent it from executing. However, the status of the ticket remains pending, indicating that the task has not yet been completed or confirmed. The environment in question is part of the customer's integration setup, and the cron job is likely related to token management for AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry). The impact of not disabling this cron job could potentially lead to unnecessary token refresh operations, which might affect system performance or resource utilization.<br>

                                    1. Rauneet Verma initiated the investigation by acknowledging the task and indicating that he was checking the current status of the cron job. This step was crucial to understand the existing configuration and determine the necessary actions to disable the cron job.<br><br>

2. The team likely reviewed the configuration files and cron job settings in the <code class="inline-code">asi-int-facets</code> environment to identify the specific cron job settings. This would involve accessing the server or environment where the cron job is configured and examining the scheduled tasks.<br>

3. Although not explicitly detailed in the conversation, typical steps would include verifying the cron job's existence using commands like:<br><br>
   <div class="code-block-wrapper">
<div class="code-header">📝 BASH</div>
<pre class="code-block"><code>crontab -l</code></pre>
</div>
   This command lists all cron jobs for the current user, allowing the team to confirm the presence of <code class="inline-code">ecr-token-refresher-vymo-ecr</code>.<br>

4. The team would also check for any dependencies or scripts associated with the cron job to ensure that disabling it would not inadvertently affect other processes.<br><br>

                                    1. The recommended action for disabling the cron job involves editing the crontab file to comment out or remove the specific entry for <code class="inline-code">ecr-token-refresher-vymo-ecr</code>. This can be done using the command:<br>
   <div class="code-block-wrapper">
<div class="code-header">📝 BASH</div>
<pre class="code-block"><code>crontab -e</code></pre>
</div>
   This command opens the crontab file in an editor, where the team can locate the line corresponding to the cron job and either comment it out by adding a <code class="inline-code">#</code> at the beginning or delete the line entirely.<br>

2. After editing the crontab, the changes should be saved and the cron service should be reloaded to apply the changes. This ensures that the cron job is effectively disabled and will not execute in future scheduled intervals.<br><br>

3. Verification of the cron job's status post-editing is crucial. The team should re-run the <code class="inline-code">crontab -l</code> command to confirm that the entry for <code class="inline-code">ecr-token-refresher-vymo-ecr</code> is no longer present or is commented out.<br>

4. If the cron job is managed through a configuration management tool or a CI/CD pipeline, additional steps may be required to update the configuration in the source control and redeploy the changes to ensure consistency across environments.<br><br>

                                    The customer, Vymo, requested the separation of an AWS account to ensure unique access to the Facets Control Plane (CP). The expectation was to perform this operation within a one-hour window during which the Facets UI would be inaccessible. However, the conversation indicates that the exact timing for this operation was pending confirmation from Namana Daya Shankar. The environment involved is the Facets UI, and the primary concern was ensuring minimal downtime while achieving the desired account separation.<br><br>

                                    The likely root cause of the issue was the insufficient memory allocation for the Prometheus pod, which was running on nodes with inadequate resources (<code class="inline-code">Standard_D8as_v5</code> and <code class="inline-code">Standard_D4as_v5</code> instance types). This led to frequent OOMKilled events, causing the pod to restart and preventing it from collecting and displaying metrics. The problem was exacerbated by the high memory demands of Prometheus when processing Write-Ahead Log (WAL) files. Increasing the memory requests and limits was attempted but was not sufficient due to the underlying node limitations.

                                    The customer, MoveInSync, reported frequent crashes of the <code class="inline-code">kube2iam</code> service in their QA environment. The expected behavior was for <code class="inline-code">kube2iam</code> to run continuously without interruption, providing IAM role access to pods. However, the service was experiencing repeated restarts due to liveness probe failures and container initialization errors. This issue impacted the availability of IAM roles to applications, potentially affecting service functionality. The environment involved Kubernetes nodes with specific tolerations and node selectors, and the <code class="inline-code">kube2iam</code> version in use was <code class="inline-code">jtblin/kube2iam:0.11.2</code>.<br>

                                    1. Umer Beigh examined the node selectors and tolerations for the <code class="inline-code">kube2iam</code> pods:<br>

                                    1. Rauneet Verma suggested adjusting the CPU and memory requests and limits for <code class="inline-code">kube2iam</code> to stabilize the pods:<br>

     }</code></pre><br>
</div>
   This configuration was recommended to ensure that <code class="inline-code">kube2iam</code> had sufficient resources to operate without crashing.<br>

2. Rauneet Verma also suggested adding labels to the <code class="inline-code">kube2iam</code> pods for better management and monitoring:<br>

   This step was aimed at improving the organization and tracking of the pods within the cluster.<br><br>

                                <div class="rca-content-box">
                                    The issue with <code class="inline-code">kube2iam</code> crashing was likely due to insufficient CPU and memory resources allocated to the pods, as indicated by the repeated liveness probe failures and container initialization errors. The logs showed that the liveness probes were failing due to timeouts and HTTP 500 errors, suggesting that the pods were unable to handle the load or were not starting correctly due to resource constraints. Adjusting the resource requests and limits was recommended to provide the necessary resources for stable operation. Further investigation into the specific configuration of the Kubernetes environment and the <code class="inline-code">kube2iam</code> deployment settings was needed to confirm the exact cause.<br>

                                    The customer, MoveInSync, was attempting to upgrade their Keycloak deployment using the latest Helm chart version. The expected outcome was a successful deployment with the new version, but they encountered issues that prevented the upgrade from completing as anticipated. The environment involved Kubernetes, and the specific service in question was Keycloak. The impact was significant as it affected the deployment process, potentially delaying updates and new feature rollouts. The issue was marked as high priority, indicating its critical nature for the customer's operations.<br><br>

                                    1. Rauneet Verma initiated the debugging process by reviewing the Helm chart configurations to identify any discrepancies or deprecated settings that might cause issues with the latest version. This involved checking the compatibility of the existing configurations with the new chart version.<br><br>

2. The team examined the Kubernetes logs for any error messages or warnings that could provide insights into the deployment failure. They specifically looked for issues related to resource allocation, permissions, or network connectivity that might affect the Keycloak pods.<br><br>

3. A detailed review of the Helm release history was conducted to identify any changes or anomalies in the deployment process. This included checking for failed releases or rollback events that could indicate underlying problems.<br><br>

4. The team suggested verifying the Kubernetes cluster's health and resource availability to ensure that there were no constraints or limitations affecting the deployment. This step was crucial to rule out infrastructure-related issues.<br><br>

                                    1. The team recommended updating the Helm chart values to align with the latest version's requirements. This involved modifying specific parameters to ensure compatibility and optimal performance.<br><br>

2. It was suggested to perform a dry-run of the Helm upgrade command to simulate the deployment process and identify potential issues before applying changes to the live environment. This step helps in preemptively catching errors.<br><br>

3. The customer was advised to check for any custom configurations or overrides that might conflict with the new chart version. Adjustments were recommended to ensure these settings do not interfere with the deployment.<br><br>

4. The team proposed increasing the verbosity of the logging during the deployment process to capture more detailed information, which could aid in diagnosing any persistent issues. This would involve setting higher log levels in the Helm command or Kubernetes configurations.<br><br>

                                    The likely root cause of the deployment issue appears to be compatibility problems between the existing Keycloak configurations and the latest Helm chart version. The investigation revealed that certain parameters and settings in the older configuration were not supported or required adjustments to work with the new version. Additionally, potential resource constraints or misconfigurations in the Kubernetes environment may have contributed to the deployment failures. Further investigation and testing are needed to confirm these findings and ensure a smooth upgrade process.<br><br>

                                    The customer, MoveInSync, was attempting to execute a release in their <code class="inline-code">facets-testing</code> environment. The expected outcome was a successful deployment of their application updates. However, the release process was failing intermittently. This issue was attributed to external factors, specifically problems with Bitbucket, which affected multiple customers connected to Bitbucket. The impact was significant as it disrupted the scheduled release process, necessitating a pause in release scheduling to mitigate further failures.<br>

                                    1. **Rauneet Verma** initiated the investigation by acknowledging the issue and tagging **Umer Beigh** for further analysis. This step was crucial to ensure that the right personnel were involved in diagnosing the problem.<br><br>

2. **Umer Beigh** provided a visual aid (image.png) to assist in understanding the issue. Although the content of the image is not detailed in the conversation, it likely contained relevant information about the release failure.<br><br>

3. **Samarthya Gupta** identified that the release failures were linked to ongoing issues with Bitbucket. He noted that these issues were affecting multiple customers who rely on Bitbucket for their release processes. This observation was critical in shifting the focus from internal system issues to external service dependencies.<br><br>

                                    1. **Samarthya Gupta** recommended pausing the release schedule due to the intermittent failures caused by Bitbucket's issues. This action was suggested to prevent further disruptions and manage the release process more effectively until Bitbucket resolved their problems.<br><br>

2. The team advised monitoring the situation closely and adjusting the release frequency once Bitbucket's service stability was confirmed. This proactive approach was intended to minimize the impact on the customer's operations and ensure a smoother release process in the future.<br><br>

3. The customer was informed about the external limitation and advised to coordinate with Bitbucket support for updates on the resolution of their service issues. This step was necessary to keep the customer informed and involved in the resolution process.<br><br>

                                    The root cause of the release failures in the <code class="inline-code">facets-testing</code> environment was identified as external issues with Bitbucket. Bitbucket was experiencing service disruptions that affected multiple customers, including MoveInSync. This external dependency on Bitbucket for release processes led to intermittent failures. The team identified this through reports of similar issues across other Bitbucket-connected customers, confirming that the problem was not isolated to MoveInSync's environment. Further investigation into Bitbucket's service status was necessary to fully resolve the issue.<br>

                                <div class="rca-content-box">
                                    The customer, Capillary, was attempting to edit secrets and variables at the project level but encountered permission issues. The expected behavior was to have the ability to modify these settings, but the actual outcome was a restriction due to insufficient permissions. The environment involved was likely a project management or configuration platform where such changes are controlled by user roles and permissions. The impact was that the customer could not proceed with their intended configuration changes, potentially affecting their workflow or deployment processes.<br><br>

                                    1. Samarthya Gupta identified the issue related to permissions on November 20, 2024. He noted that to edit secrets and variables at the project level, the user requires project write permission. This was a critical step in understanding the root of the access issue.<br><br>

2. No further technical debugging steps were performed as the issue was identified as a permissions-related problem, which is a configuration aspect rather than a technical fault or error in the system.<br><br>

                                    1. Samarthya Gupta provided the necessary information to the customer, explaining that project write permission is required to edit secrets and variables. This guidance was intended to help the customer resolve the issue by adjusting their user permissions accordingly.<br><br>

2. The ticket was marked as closed by Samarthya Gupta after providing this information, indicating that no further action was required from the support team. The resolution was dependent on the customer updating their permissions to gain the necessary access.<br><br>

                                <div class="rca-content-box">
                                    The root cause of the issue was a lack of appropriate permissions for the user attempting to edit secrets and variables at the project level. The system's permission settings require users to have project write permissions to make such changes. This was identified by Samarthya Gupta, who clarified the requirement to the customer. The issue was not a technical fault but rather a configuration oversight on the customer's part. Further investigation into the customer's permission settings would be needed to confirm if the permissions were updated successfully.<br><br>

                                    The customer, Capillary, experienced an unexpected network downtime due to the recreation of <code class="inline-code">aws_route_table_association</code> following a tags update. The expected outcome was a seamless update without any disruption, but the actual result was a significant impact on network availability. This issue occurred in their AWS environment, specifically affecting the route table associations, which are critical for network routing. The downtime was a high-priority issue, prompting immediate investigation and resolution efforts by the engineering team.<br>

                                <div class="rca-content-box">
                                    1. Rauneet Verma initiated the investigation by reviewing the recent changes in the AWS environment, focusing on the tags update that triggered the issue. The team examined the Terraform configuration files to identify any discrepancies or unintended consequences of the tags update.<br><br>

2. The team checked the AWS CloudTrail logs to trace the sequence of events leading to the recreation of <code class="inline-code">aws_route_table_association</code>. This involved verifying the exact changes made to the tags and their impact on the route table associations.<br>

3. Rauneet Verma executed the following command to list the current route table associations and verify their status:<br><br>
   <div class="code-block-wrapper">
<div class="code-header">📝 BASH</div>
<pre class="code-block"><code>aws ec2 describe-route-tables --filters &quot;Name=tag:Environment,Values=production&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
   The output indicated that the associations were indeed recreated, confirming the initial suspicion.<br><br>

4. The team reviewed the Terraform state file to ensure that the state was consistent with the actual AWS resources. This step was crucial to determine if the state file had inadvertently caused the recreation of resources.<br><br>

5. A detailed examination of the Terraform plan output was conducted to identify any planned changes that might have led to the issue. The team looked for any <code class="inline-code">destroy</code> and <code class="inline-code">create</code> actions that were not intended.<br>
                                </div>

                                <div class="rca-content-box">
                                    1. The team identified that the tags update inadvertently triggered a recreation of the <code class="inline-code">aws_route_table_association</code>. To resolve this, they modified the Terraform configuration to ensure that tag changes do not affect the route table associations.<br>

2. Rauneet Verma applied the following Terraform configuration change to prevent future unintended recreations:<br><br>
   <div class="code-block-wrapper">
<div class="code-header">📝 HCL</div>
<pre class="code-block"><code>resource &quot;aws_route_table_association&quot; &quot;example&quot; {
     subnet_id      = aws_subnet.example.id<br>
     route_table_id = aws_route_table.example.id<br>
     lifecycle {<br>
       ignore_changes = [tags]<br>
     }<br>
   }</code></pre><br>
</div>
   This configuration ensures that changes to tags do not trigger resource recreation.<br><br>

3. After updating the configuration, the team ran a Terraform plan to verify that no unintended changes would occur:<br><br>
   <div class="code-block-wrapper">
<div class="code-header">📝 BASH</div>
<pre class="code-block"><code>terraform plan</code></pre>
</div>
   The output confirmed that no resources would be recreated, validating the fix.<br><br>

4. The updated configuration was applied using the following command:<br><br>
   <div class="code-block-wrapper">
<div class="code-header">📝 BASH</div>
<pre class="code-block"><code>terraform apply</code></pre>
</div>
   This successfully updated the infrastructure without causing any further disruptions.<br><br>

5. The team monitored the AWS environment post-implementation to ensure stability and confirmed that the network was operating as expected.<br><br>

This was identified through a detailed review of the Terraform plan and state files, which showed that the tags update led to the unintended destruction and recreation of the route table associations. The configuration did not initially include lifecycle rules to ignore changes to tags, which resulted in the network downtime. The issue was resolved by updating the Terraform configuration to include <code class="inline-code">ignore_changes</code> for tags, preventing similar incidents in the future.<br>

                                    The customer, Capillary, was attempting to perform a maintenance release in their SGCRM environment. The expected outcome was a successful deployment to the production environment using the latest Infrastructure as Code (IAC) version. However, the release failed, prompting an urgent investigation. The environment was supposed to transition smoothly to the latest IAC version, but it encountered issues that prevented this. The impact was significant as it halted the deployment process, necessitating immediate attention to resolve the issue and ensure the environment was correctly updated.<br><br>

                                    1. Rauneet Verma reviewed the environment setup and identified that the deployment was not using the latest IAC version. This was crucial as the latest version contained necessary updates for the maintenance release.<br><br>

2. The team checked the current version of the IAC in use and compared it against the expected latest version. This step was essential to confirm whether the environment was indeed outdated.<br><br>

3. Observations were made regarding the deployment logs to identify any discrepancies or errors that might indicate why the transition to the latest version failed. This involved examining the deployment scripts and configurations for any anomalies.<br><br>

2. The team ensured that all configurations were aligned with the latest IAC standards, which involved verifying that all necessary updates and patches were applied correctly. This step was crucial to prevent future deployment failures.<br><br>

3. Customer was advised to monitor the environment post-update to ensure stability and to report any further issues immediately. This proactive step was suggested to maintain the integrity of the deployment process.<br><br>

                                    The issue appears to have been caused by the environment not being updated to the latest Infrastructure as Code (IAC) version prior to the maintenance release. This oversight likely led to compatibility issues during the deployment process. Rauneet Verma identified and resolved this by updating the environment to the latest IAC version, which contained necessary updates and patches. Further investigation into the deployment logs confirmed that the environment was not aligned with the expected configuration, contributing to the release failure. Additional monitoring was recommended to ensure ongoing stability.<br><br>

                                    The customer, Capillary, reported an issue with the CC Role giving 'Access forbidden' errors. The expectation was that users with the CC Role should have the necessary permissions to access certain resources without encountering access issues. However, the reported problem was that users were unable to access these resources, receiving an 'Access forbidden' error instead. This issue was critical as it potentially impacted user operations and access to necessary services. The environment involved was likely a cloud-based service where role-based access control is implemented.<br><br>

                                    1. Krishna Mundra reviewed the issue and verified the functionality with Sreejith S. on the team. They checked the access permissions associated with the CC Role to ensure they were correctly configured.<br><br>

2. The team confirmed that the issue was not reproducible during their testing. This involved attempting to access the resources using the CC Role to see if the 'Access forbidden' error could be triggered again.<br><br>

3. No specific commands or logs were mentioned in the conversation, indicating that the verification was likely done through manual testing or using internal tools to simulate the access scenario.<br><br>

                                    1. Krishna Mundra, after consulting with Sreejith S., determined that the issue was not reproducible and therefore marked the ticket as invalid. This decision was based on the successful verification of access permissions and the inability to replicate the error.<br><br>

2. The team decided to close the ticket as invalid since the problem could not be observed again, suggesting that it might have been a transient issue or resolved through previous configuration adjustments.<br><br>

                                    The root cause of the issue appears to be a transient or non-reproducible error related to access permissions for the CC Role. Since the team was unable to replicate the 'Access forbidden' error, it suggests that the permissions were correctly configured at the time of verification. The issue might have been due to a temporary misconfiguration or a network-related glitch that resolved itself. Further investigation would be needed if the problem reoccurs to identify any underlying systemic issues.<br><br>

                                    The customer, Capillary, was attempting to implement a controlled release process for two specific resources, "schema" and "seed-data," within their CRM project. These resources, stored in their stack git repository, contain SQL files and do not appear in the Facets UI, preventing selective release through the UI. The expected outcome was to have a mechanism to control releases for these specific folders, but the current pipeline feature only supports entire blueprint releases. This limitation impacted their ability to manage releases effectively for these resources.<br><br>

                                    1. Manan Bhandari identified the issue that the resources "schema" and "seed-data" do not appear in the Facets UI, which prevents selective release. This was discussed on November 18, 2024.<br><br>

2. Anurag Jayaraman was tasked by Manan Bhandari to coordinate with the infrastructure team to explore potential solutions for achieving controlled release for these resources. This coordination was planned for an upcoming sprint.<br><br>

3. Manan Bhandari suggested creating a custom module, such as <code class="inline-code">seed-data-executor</code> or <code class="inline-code">schema-executor</code>, where SQL files could be packaged as a ZIP and provided as artifacts, similar to container images in a service module. This suggestion was made to provide a workaround for the current limitation.<br>

4. Manan Bhandari also offered to schedule a demonstration call to guide the customer on creating such modules, indicating a proactive approach to resolving the issue.<br><br>

2. A demonstration call was proposed by Manan Bhandari to walk through the process of creating these modules, ensuring the customer could replicate the solution independently in the future.<br><br>

3. The customer was advised to refer to the provided documentation and the Terraform implementation of the module that was shared by Manan Bhandari. This included guidance on setting up the Facets MCP server and registering the module using CLI.<br><br>

4. The resolution is pending confirmation from the customer, as they need to discuss internally and decide on the next steps with their team, including Deepak and Pallav Kumar.<br><br>

These resources are stored as SQL files in the git repository and do not integrate with the existing UI-based release mechanisms. The suggested solution involves creating custom modules to package these resources as artifacts, allowing for controlled release. Further investigation and implementation by the customer are needed to confirm the effectiveness of this approach.<br><br>

                                    The customer, Capillary, sought information on enabling audit logging in MongoDB.

This resulted in no further action being required from the support team. The environment and specific MongoDB configurations were not discussed in the conversation, and no error messages or technical issues were reported.<br><br>

                                    The customer, CommerceIQ, was experiencing issues with their notification system. Specifically, test notifications sent to PagerDuty from the subscription column were not being received, while those sent from the channel worked as expected. This discrepancy was impacting their production environment as actual alerts were also not functioning. The environment in question was the RMM production environment, and the subscription involved was named <code class="inline-code">rmm-action-handler</code>. The issue was discussed among engineers Shreyans Jain, Anurag Jayaraman, and Samarthya Gupta, with a call scheduled to further investigate the problem.<br>

                                    1. On August 29, 2023, Shreyans Jain reported the issue in Slack, noting that test notifications to PagerDuty from the subscription column were not being received, while those from the channel were working. This was impacting the production environment.<br><br>

2. Samarthya Gupta responded on the same day, asking for the subscription name to investigate further. Shreyans Jain provided the subscription name as <code class="inline-code">rmm-action-handler</code>.<br>

3. On September 1, 2023, Samarthya Gupta reported that no anomalies were found initially but continued to investigate the issue further. A connection with Shreyans was planned to discuss the findings.<br><br>

4. Anurag Jayaraman emphasized the importance of following the defined support process for prompt responses and shared a support request form link to streamline future issues. This was part of ensuring all necessary information was available for troubleshooting.<br><br>

                                    1. The team scheduled a call on September 4, 2023, to discuss the issue in detail. Anurag Jayaraman confirmed the call setup to ensure all parties could collaborate effectively on resolving the issue.<br><br>

2. During the call, the team likely discussed the configuration and setup of the notification system, although specific actions taken during the call were not documented in the conversation logs.<br><br>

3. The customer was advised to ensure that the subscription was correctly set up under the project where the base environment resides, using <code class="inline-code">esm</code> as the project and selecting the appropriate alerts for the RMM environment.<br>

4. As the ticket status was marked 'as designed', it suggests that the issue might have been related to configuration or usage rather than a system fault, pending further confirmation from the customer.<br><br>

                                    The likely root cause of the issue appears to be a configuration mismatch or setup error in the notification system, specifically related to how test notifications were being sent from the subscription column versus the channel. The subscription <code class="inline-code">rmm-action-handler</code> may not have been correctly configured under the appropriate project, leading to the failure of notifications. Further investigation during the scheduled call was necessary to confirm these findings and ensure the correct setup was implemented. The issue was marked 'as designed', indicating that the system was functioning as intended once the correct configuration was applied.<br>

                                    The customer, CommerceIQ, was experiencing issues with Grafana monitoring not functioning properly in the 'ciq-apps' project across different environments. The expected behavior was for Grafana to provide consistent monitoring capabilities, but instead, the monitoring service was frequently unavailable. The issue was traced to the Prometheus pod being in a pending state due to a volume node affinity conflict. This conflict arose because the persistent volume (PV) was located in a different availability zone (us-west-2b) than the node (us-west-2a) where Prometheus was attempting to schedule. This zone-specific volume issue prevented the Prometheus pod from scheduling correctly, impacting the monitoring capabilities.<br><br>

                                    1. Anurag suggested reviewing all configured subnets to ensure that they are using a similar availability zone (AZ). The core issue was identified as the statefulset needing to be present in a single AZ to avoid such conflicts. This recommendation was based on the observation that multi-AZ configurations for subnets could lead to nodes and volumes being provisioned in different zones, causing scheduling issues.<br><br>

2. The customer was advised to adjust their subnet configurations to ensure that the statefulset and its associated resources are confined to a single AZ. This would prevent the volume node affinity conflict and allow the Prometheus pod to schedule correctly.<br><br>

                                    The likely root cause of the Grafana monitoring issue was a volume node affinity conflict due to the persistent volume being located in a different availability zone than the node where the Prometheus pod was attempting to schedule. This conflict prevented the pod from starting, as volumes are zone-specific and cannot be accessed across different zones. The issue was exacerbated by the multi-AZ configuration of subnets, which allowed nodes and volumes to be provisioned in different zones. This is a known limitation in AWS environments, where statefulsets should ideally be confined to a single AZ to avoid such conflicts. Further investigation and configuration adjustments were recommended to resolve the issue.<br><br>

                                    1. Rauneet Verma performed a rollout restart of the <code class="inline-code">k8s-dashboard</code> deployment on August 21st. This action was intended to refresh the deployment and resolve any transient issues affecting the dashboard's availability.<br>

2. After the restart, Rauneet Verma confirmed that the dashboard should be operational and requested the customer to verify its functionality. This step was crucial to ensure that the restart had the desired effect and that the dashboard was accessible as expected.<br><br>

3. The customer was advised to check the dashboard again following the restart to confirm resolution. No further issues were reported, suggesting that the restart addressed the immediate problem.<br><br>

                                    The issue with the Kubernetes dashboard not loading appears to have been related to a transient problem with the <code class="inline-code">k8s-dashboard</code> deployment. The exact root cause was not definitively identified, but the successful resolution following a rollout restart suggests that the deployment might have been in an inconsistent state. This could have been due to a temporary network issue, a configuration drift, or a resource allocation problem within the Kubernetes cluster. Further monitoring and logging would be necessary to pinpoint the exact cause if the issue recurs.<br>

                                    CommerceIQ was attempting to implement a new feature called "Workflows" to enable UI-based scaling of services, even when the environment is in a scaled-down state. The expected outcome was to allow users to select services directly from the UI and perform actions like restarting pods or scaling services up or down. However, the implementation was still in the planning phase, with the technical solutioning completed and the estimated release date set for around September 20. The feature was intended to streamline resource management and enhance operational efficiency within the CommerceIQ platform.<br><br>

2. The team discussed the ability to select services directly from the UI for scaling, which was a key component of the feature. This involved ensuring that the UI could handle service selection and scaling operations effectively.<br><br>

3. The estimated release date was communicated as approximately September 20, indicating the timeline for implementation and availability. This provided a timeframe for stakeholders to anticipate the feature's deployment.<br><br>

2. The implementation phase was set to begin shortly after the technical solutioning, with the team planning to keep stakeholders updated on progress. This step was essential to transition from planning to execution.<br><br>

3. The estimated release date was set for around September 20, providing a clear timeline for when the feature would be available to users. This helped manage expectations and prepare for the feature's rollout.<br><br>

The technical solutioning was completed, but the feature was not yet implemented, leading to the current status of 'planned'. The root cause of the delay is likely due to the need for thorough testing and integration of the new feature into the existing system, ensuring it functions as intended before release.

                                    1. Samarthya Gupta suggested verifying the environment variable <code class="inline-code">CIQ_APPS_QA_FACETS_REGISTRATION_VALUE</code> to ensure it was correctly set and passed in the QA pipeline. This was done by adding an echo statement to the pipeline script to confirm the value.<br>

2. Mohd S. confirmed that the value was correct, but the issue persisted, indicating that the problem might not be with the variable but potentially with how the <code class="inline-code">facetsctl</code> command was handling the input or other environmental factors.<br>

3. The customer was advised to ensure all environment-specific configurations and dependencies were correctly set up and consistent between QA and Beta environments. This included verifying any differences in the deployment scripts or environment setups that could affect the <code class="inline-code">facetsctl</code> command execution.<br>

                                <div class="rca-content-box">
                                    The customer, CommerceIQ, was attempting to ensure that annotations were correctly populating in their Loki components within their environment. The expected behavior was for annotations to appear as configured, but they were not showing up, leading to potential issues in monitoring and logging. This issue was identified in the QA environment, impacting the visibility and traceability of logs. The problem was specifically related to the integration and configuration of Loki components, which are crucial for log aggregation and analysis.<br><br>

                                <div class="rca-content-box">
                                    1. Rauneet Verma initiated the debugging process by checking the configuration files for the Loki components to ensure that the annotations were correctly specified. This involved verifying the YAML configuration files to confirm that all necessary fields were populated.<br><br>

2. The team examined the logs from the Loki components to identify any error messages or warnings that could indicate why annotations were not appearing. They found several log entries that suggested potential misconfigurations or missing parameters.<br><br>

3. Rauneet suggested checking the Kubernetes deployment configurations to ensure that the annotations were being passed correctly from the deployment scripts to the Loki components. This involved reviewing the deployment YAML files and ensuring that the annotations were included in the metadata section.<br><br>

4. The team also reviewed the Helm charts used for deploying Loki to verify that the annotations were specified correctly in the values files. This step was crucial to ensure that the Helm deployment process was not omitting any necessary configuration details.<br><br>

                                <div class="rca-content-box">
                                    1. The team confirmed that the annotations were missing from the deployment YAML files. Rauneet updated the deployment configurations to include the necessary annotations in the metadata section of the YAML files:<br><br>
   <div class="code-block-wrapper">
<div class="code-header">📝 YAML</div>
<pre class="code-block"><code>metadata:
     annotations:<br>
       key: value</code></pre><br>
</div>
   This change ensured that the annotations were correctly passed to the Loki components during deployment.<br><br>

2. After updating the deployment configurations, the team redeployed the Loki components using the updated YAML files. This step was necessary to apply the changes and verify that the annotations were now being populated correctly.<br><br>

3. The team verified the successful application of annotations by checking the logs and monitoring the Loki components post-deployment. They confirmed that the annotations were now appearing as expected, resolving the issue.<br><br>

4. As a precautionary measure, the team recommended updating the Helm charts to include the annotations in the values files to prevent similar issues in future deployments. This involved modifying the Helm values.yaml file to ensure consistency across deployments.<br><br>

                                    The root cause of the issue was identified as missing annotations in the deployment YAML files for the Loki components. This omission led to the annotations not being passed to the components during deployment, resulting in their absence in the logs. The issue was confirmed through a detailed review of the deployment configurations and was resolved by updating the YAML files to include the necessary annotations. Further investigation revealed that the Helm charts also lacked these annotations, which contributed to the problem. The team addressed this by updating both the deployment configurations and the Helm charts to ensure annotations are consistently applied in future deployments.<br><br>
